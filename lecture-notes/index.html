              <p class="ltx_p">This is a collection of lecture notes that I have written up using my personal notes from my undergraduate at the University of St Andrews. They consist of physics, astronomy, and maths topics ranging in complexity from first-year undergrad up to graduate level. I have chosen to type them up and put them online in case anyone finds them useful!</p>

            <div class="ltx_para">
              <p class="ltx_p">Currently there is an HTML version for some of the sets of notes I am working on. My goal is for there to be both an HTML and PDF version for all the notes eventually. You can flick through the notes that have been (at least partially) completed using the sidebar on the left.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ltx_para">
              <p class="ltx_p">The collection is currently incomplete. There are many more notes still to be uploaded and even the ones that are online still have lots of improvements and clarifications to be made. The most complete sets of notes as of writing are the ones on <a class="external-link" href="./classical-mechanics/">Classical Mechanics</a> and <a class="external-link" href="./real-analysis/">Real Analysis</a>, both of which are early undergrad level. See the end of this page for an incomplete list of upcoming changes!</p>

              <p class="ltx_p">These notes are for anyone who is interested, but they are mostly aimed at students of physics and mathematics. I definitely wouldn't recommend using them as a primary source as, apart from being incomplete, there are plenty of superior lecture notes written by actual real-life teachers out there!</p>

The text and mathematics was all written by me, and the diagrams all were drawn by me using TikZ.</p>

              <p class="ltx_p">I plan to make a much more detailed post about the conversion process in the future for those that are interested.
